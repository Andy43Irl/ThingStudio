		<p>ThingStudio is a UI editor and server for MQTT based networks. You can create dynamic, real-time UI's for the Internet of Things using only HTML based templates</p>
	
		<p>Unlike the majority of cloud platforms for the Internet of Things, ThingStudio does not require you to send home network data into a proprietary platform. Your IoT data stays within your network, and we just provide the UI's that you design.</p>
	
		<p>You get the convenience of a cloud based service for the complex task of designing and managing UI's, and the privacy, speed and low latency of your own network handling your data</p>
		
		<p><strong>ThingStudio is very new, so please, allow for this, and ask for help, send us bug reports, and give us suggestions!</strong></p>
