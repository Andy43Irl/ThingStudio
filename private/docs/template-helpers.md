The table below describes our built-in template helpers. To use these helpers in your templates, simply enclose them in double curly braces, and include the name of the feed to process with the helper. For example:

<pre>
{{|message "feedTitleHere"}}
</pre>

To learn more about helpers and templates in general, read the [Meteor documentation](http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/). If you would like to create your own custom template helpers, [read this doc](/docs/custom_helpers).
